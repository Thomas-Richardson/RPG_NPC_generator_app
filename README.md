# RPG_NPC_generator_app
A streamlit applet that I use in my Sci-Fi RPG games. It gives me quick inspiration for non player characters (NPCs) by generating random combinations of physical and personality traits, as well as names, nicknames, and interesting flavours (e.g. "secretly rich" or "heavily cybered up") to make them memorable. 

I run it locally from my laptop during sessions (just open a terminal, navigate to the folder and type `streamlit run app.py`).

I have come up with custom lists of personality traits, physical traits, clothing and such from scratch. These are txt files that are imported into the app. In theory you could use your own or modify mine to tailor the generator to your own campaign.

It also has an export to markdown function that I use to write NPCs to a markdown file in my personal note system. If the players like a character and I sense they'll make a reappeance, the export button appends them to a file of NPCs in my notes. I can then 

NOTE! This will not work for you unless you set the filepath to export to.

If you think this is cool and want help using it for your games, or have improvements, let me know!
